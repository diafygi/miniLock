##Pre-Release Software
miniLock is currently audited, peer-reviewed software. However, before a general release, we would like to allow a feedback period. We encourage further review of the software before a release is made for general public use. We hope to provide a public release by August 2014. Our first release platform will be Google Chrome and Chrome OS.

miniLock's audit documents will be released as soon as the auditing team finishes their editing process (by the third week of July 2014). miniLock also ships with a Unit Test Kit located in `test`.

##0. Overview
miniLock is a small, portable file encryption software. The idea behind its design is that a passphrase, memorized by the user, can act as a complete, portable basis for a persistent public key identity and provide a full substitute for other key pair models, such as having the key pair stored on disk media (the PGP approach).  

Advancements in elliptic curve cryptography, specifically in systems such as `curve25519`, allow us to generate key pairs where the lengths of both public and private keys are relatively very small. This means that public keys become far easier to share (miniLock public keys, called *miniLock IDs*, fit inside less than half a tweet). This also means that a human-memorizable passphrase of adequate entropy can be used as the basis for deriving a private key.

When first opened, miniLock asks the user for their passphrase which it then uses to derive the user's private and public keys. Via this model, the user can establish their key pair on any computer that has miniLock installed using only this passphrase, without having to manage key files or identities and so on. Thanks to the small key sizes present in `curve25519`, we are guaranteed small, easily tweetable public keys and private keys that can be derived from passphrases. miniLock also contains checks to ensure the passphrases entered by the user are of sufficient entropy. miniLock will refuse weak passphrases completely and instead suggest stronger passphrases for use by the user.

miniLock then allows the user to encrypt files to other miniLock users via their miniLock IDs and decrypt files sent to them. miniLock's encryption format supports encrypting a single file to multiple recipients with a negligible increase in file size. Another feature is that analyzing a miniLock-encrypted file does not yield the miniLock IDs of the recipients, only of the sender.

miniLock file encryption provides both confidentiality and integrity. miniLock uses the [TweetNaCL](http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to) cryptography library, [ported to JavaScript](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js), entirely due to its focus on simplicity, auditability and small size. Similarly, miniLock is designed to be as simple, portable, auditable and usable as possible. miniLock also uses [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) for "memory-hard" key derivation.

##1. User Flow
This section outlines an example user flow in order to help demonstrate how miniLock is supposed to help people.

Alice wants to send a scan of her passport to Bob. Sending it over email would compromise personal information, so Alice decided to first encrypt the scan using miniLock.

Bob opens miniLock and enters his passphrase. miniLock displays his miniLock ID, which is tied to his passphrase and is persistent. He sends Alice his miniLock ID, which looks something like this:
`HUG7p95ffj5B1FRbsE5VCF3ZaKF5q5GHBLYqoQxWHZdY`

Alice drags and drops her passport scan into miniLock and enters Bob's miniLock ID as the recipient. She clicks the encrypt button and sends the resulting `.minilock` file to Bob. Once Bob drags the encrypted file into miniLock, it automatically detects it as a miniLock-encrypted file destined to Bob, and decrypts and saves the passport scan on his computer.

##2. Key Derivation
miniLock uses the [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library in order to impose a strict limit on the amount of detected entropy present in entered passphrases. miniLock will not allow passphrases that fall below the threshold of 100 bits of entropy: if a passphrase of lower entropy is detected, miniLock will refuse it and will not allow access to encryption or decryption functions.

Users are encouraged to use passphrases which are easier to remember but harder to guess. If a user fails to enter a sufficiently entropic passphrase, miniLock will use a built-in dictionary of the 58,110 most common words in the English language to suggest a seven-word passphrase. This gives us a passphrase with approximately 111 bits of entropy, since 58110<sup>7</sup> ~= 2<sup>111</sup>.

Once we obtain a suitable passphrase, we hash it using `SHA-512` and then derive the user's 32-byte private key by applying `scrypt` onto the obtained hash using the following parameters:

* N = 2<sup>17</sup>
* r = 8,
* p = 1,
* L = 32

The key derivation salt is constant and is composed of the following 16 bytes:

```
0x6d, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x69
0x4c, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x6b
0x53, 0x63, 0x72, 0x79
0x70, 0x74, 0x2e, 0x2e
```

Once we obtain our 32-byte private key, the public key is derived for use with the TweetNaCL `curve25519-xsalsa20-poly1305` construction.

The user's `miniLock ID` is a Base58 representation of their public key, meant to be easily communicable via email or instant messaging.


##3. File format
miniLock saves encrypted files as binary blobs with the following format:

```
Bytes signaling beginning of header
Header bytes
Bytes signaling ending of header
Ciphertext bytes
```

The beginning of the header is signaled with the following 16 bytes:

```
0x6d, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x69,
0x4c, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x6b,
0x46, 0x69, 0x6c, 0x65,
0x59, 0x65, 0x73, 0x2e
```

The end of the header is signaled with the following 16 bytes:

```
0x6d, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x69,
0x4c, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x6b,
0x45, 0x6e, 0x64, 0x49,
0x6e, 0x66, 0x6f, 0x2e
```

The header itself is a stringified JSON object which contains information necessary for the recipients to decrypt the file. The JSON object has the following format:

```
{
	senderID: Sender's miniLock ID,
	fileInfo: {
		(One copy of the below object for every recipient.)
		Unique nonce for decrypting this object (Base64): {
			fileKey: Key for file decryption (Base64),
			fileName: The file's original filename (String),
			fileNonce: Nonce for file decryption (Base64),
		}
		(Encrypted with shared secret derived from the sender’s
		 private key and recipient's public key.
		 Stored as Base64 string.)
	}
}
```

Note that in the above header, `fileName` is padded with the `0x00` byte until it reaches 256 bytes in length. This is done in order to prevent the discovery of the `fileName` length purely by analyzing an encrypted miniLock file's header.

##4. File encryption
We begin by appending the bytes signalling the beginning of the header to the final encrypted file.

A random 32-byte `fileKey` and a random 24-byte `fileNonce` are generated and used to symmetrically encrypt the plaintext bytes using TweetNaCL's `xsalsa20-poly1305` construction.

`fileKey`, `fileNonce` and `fileName` (the file's intended name upon decryption) are then stored within the JSON header as described in §3. The name of the `fileInfo` property in which they are stored is a 24-byte nonce, which is used to then encrypt the underlying object asymmetrically according to the recipient's public key(s) using TweetNaCL's `curve25519-xsalsa20-poly1305` construction. This is done once for every recipient. For `n` recipients, we will obtain `n` properties of `fileInfo` with nonces as the property name and a Base64-encrypted object as the property value.

TweetNaCL's `curve25519-xsalsa20-poly1305` construction provides authenticated encryption, guaranteeing both confidentiality and ciphertext integrity.

Finally, we append the bytes signalling the end of the header, followed by the ciphertext bytes.

##5. File decryption
In order to decrypt the file, the recipient needs the `fileKey` and the `fileNonce`, which are within the `fileInfo` section of the header. They also will need the `senderID` property of the header in order to derive the shared secret which can be used to decrypt their copies of the `fileKey` and `fileNonce` contained within `fileInfo`.

If there are multiple properties within `fileInfo`, the recipient must iterate through every property until she obtains an authenticated decryption of the underlying object. Once a successful authenticated decryption of a `fileInfo` property occurs, the recipient can then use the obtained `fileKey` and `fileNonce` to perform an authenticated decryption of the ciphertext bytes. The recipient then proceeds to remove the padding of `0x00` bytes from `fileName` in order to obtain the intended file name. The recipient is now capable of saving the decrypted file.

If the authenticated asymmetric decryption of the header object fails, or the authenticated symmetric decryption of the file ciphertext fails, we return an error to the user and halt decryption. No partial data is returned.

##6. Key Identity Authentication
In PGP, public keys can be substantially larger than miniLock IDs, therefore necessitating the generation of key fingerprints which can then be used for out-of-band key identity authentication. With miniLock, users are able to authenticate out-of-band directly using the miniLock ID, due to its small length (approximately 44 Base58-encoded characters). Therefore, no specialized key identity authentication mechanism is required.

##7. Caveats
miniLock is not intended to protect against malicious files being sent and received. It is the user's responsibility to vet the safety of the files they send or receive over miniLock. miniLock cannot protect against malware being sent over it.
